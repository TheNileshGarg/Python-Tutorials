# input() functions reads user input from console and returns it as a string 
name = input("Please enter your name. ")
print("My name is", name)

age = int(input("Please enter your age (in years) "))
print("I am", age, "years old")

# If we do not type cast, then user input will show the behavior of string as it is a string 
# You will learn error handling in future so that you can handle if user enters different type than 
# .. one you want to typecast
